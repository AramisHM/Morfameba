## Morfameba

Morfameba is a college work in witch we developed a dynamic morphological image processing. Such technique sweeps pixel per pixel in an image analyzing a region that may vary its shape depending on the color gradience. It is particulary handy for more efficient image filtering, more specifically on filters to remove noise, mainly because it preservs the edges and removes the regions wich presents noise.
